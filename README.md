# 🐦 BirdWatching

This is a small .NET application built for **training and review purposes**.  
It serves as a sandbox project to explore and practice:

- 🌐 Building Web APIs with ASP.NET Core
- 🔐 JWT authentication basics
- 💾 Entity Framework Core with Code-First Migrations
- 📦 Docker + Docker Compose
- 🔄 Asynchronous programming with async/await
- ☁️ (Optional) Integrating OAuth or message queues in the future

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this project is **not** to build a production-ready system,  
but rather to revisit and reinforce foundational backend concepts in a hands-on way.

Feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements!
